Personalized Learning Assistant (PLA) - Backend

FastAPI backend powering a personalized MCQ-based learning platform for adaptive assessments.

## Project Overview

The Personalized Learning Assistant (PLA) backend serves as the core engine for adaptive, personalized MCQ-based testing.Students select a Subject â†’ Topic â†’ Sub-topic, and the system dynamically adjusts difficulty based on performance using a three-tier flow:

Easy âž” Remedial âž” Medium âž” Remedial âž” Hard

Weighted scoring and immediate feedback enhance the learning experience.

Designed for K-12 education, the system helps identify student strengths and areas for improvement.

Features

Subject â†’ Topic â†’ Sub-topic based MCQ tests

Adaptive difficulty progression (Easy â†’ Medium â†’ Hard)

Remedial questions for partial understanding

Weighted scoring system

Fast, async API built with FastAPI

Organized for easy extension (new subjects, topics, MCQs)

Clean separation of logic for scalability

Tech Stack

Python 3.10+

FastAPI

Uvicorn (for local server running)

Pydantic (for data validation)

CORS Middleware (for frontend-backend communication)
